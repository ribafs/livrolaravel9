To complete this trick, just create a Command Prompt shortcut on the desktop, enter the shortcut's properties and then select the Run as administrator box, located in the Advanced button on the Shortcut tab. 

Change the Prompt Text 
 Did you know the prompt itself is completely customizable thanks to the prompt command? It is, and when we say customizable, we mean really customizable.

Instead of C:\>, you can set the prompt to any text you want, have it include the time, the current drive, the Windows version number (like in this example image), you name it.

One useful example is prompt $m$p$g, which will show the full path of a mapped drive, alongside the drive letter. 

You can always execute prompt alone, without options, to return it to its sometimes boring default.

Customize the Command Prompt Title Bar Text 

 Tired of that "Command Prompt" title bar text? No problem, just use the title command to change it to say whatever you like.

For example, let's say your name is Maria Smith, and you want to express your ownership of the Command Prompt. Execute this and the title bar will change immediately:

title Property of Maria Smith

The change won't stick, so the next time you open Command Prompt, the title bar will be back to normal.

The title command is usually used to help give a custom appearance in script files and batch filesâ€”not that titling it with your name isn't a good idea! 

Open the Command Prompt From Any Location 


Use Robocopy as a Backup Solution 
 Thanks to the robocopy command, you don't need to use Window's backup software or install a free backup software tool.

Just execute the following, obviously replacing the source and destination folders with whatever you'd like to back up and where it should go.

robocopy c:\users\ellen\documents f:\mybackup\documents /copyall /e /r:0 /dcopy:t /mir

The robocopy command with these options functions identically to an incremental backup software tool, keeping both locations in sync.

You don't have this command if you're using Windows XP or earlier. However, you do have the xcopy command, which can be used to do something very similar:

xcopy c:\users\ellen\documents f:\mybackup\documents /c /d /e /h /i /k /q /r /s /x /y

No matter which command you choose to use, just create a batch file containing the command and schedule it to run in Task Scheduler, and you'll have your own custom-made backup solution. 


ipconfig /all
